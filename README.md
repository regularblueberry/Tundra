## Project Overview

**Tundra** is an operating system evironment which intends to provide an **infinitly portable** and **highly customizable** experience to both users and developers
via its **modular approach** to operating system design. Tundra is not a compatbility layer which to build your app on but instead as the ***"glue"*** between 
various different compatibility layers for systems and devices. 

## Current Status: Work in Progress
